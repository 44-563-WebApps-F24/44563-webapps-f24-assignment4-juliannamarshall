        <h3>Antigone by Sophocles</h3>
        <p class="speech">
            <h4 class="ant">ANT.</h4> Both may be equal yonder; who can tell?
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h4 class="cr">CR.</h4> An enemy is hated even in death.
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h4 class="ant">ANT.</h4> Love, and not hatred, is the part for me.

        <p class="speech">
            <h4 class="cr">CR.</h4> Down then to death! and, if you must, there love The dead. No woman rules me while I live.

            <h4 class="ch">CH.</h4> Now comes Ismen√® forth. Ah, see, From clouds above her brow The sister-loving tear Is falling wet on her fair cheek, Distaining all her passion-crimson'd face!

            <h4 class="cr">CR.</h4>And thou, that like a serpent coiled i' the house Hast secretly been draining my life-blood,-- Little aware that I was cherishing Two curses and subverters of my throne,-- Tell us, wilt thou avouch thy share in this Entombment, or forswear all knowledge of it?
        </p>
        <p class="speech">
            <h4 class="ism">ISM.</h4>If her voice go therewith, I did the deed, And bear my part and burden of the blame.
